Implementation Steps for Missing Core Elements

1. Natural Language Understanding:
   - Enhance the get_openai_response function to handle complex queries and follow-up questions.
   - Example: Add code to manage context and keep track of conversation history.
   DONE

2. Context Management:
   - Implement a context management system using a dictionary or database to store and retrieve conversation context.
   - Example: Add a context dictionary to store user-specific data.
   DONE

3. Task Execution:
   - Extend the task management functions to include more capabilities like setting reminders or sending emails.
   - Example: Integrate with a calendar API to manage events.

4. Knowledge Integration:
   - Use APIs like Wolfram Alpha or Wikipedia to fetch information and integrate them into the assistant.
   - Example: Create a function to query an external knowledge base and return the results.

5. Personalization:
   - Store user preferences and history in a file or database.
   - Example: Create a user profile management system to track user preferences.

6. Error Handling and Recovery:
   - Implement fallback mechanisms to handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
   - Example: Add try-except blocks around critical code sections to catch and handle errors gracefully.

7. Voice Interaction:
   - Improve speech recognition accuracy by tuning parameters and handling different accents.
   - Example: Use additional libraries like pyaudio for better microphone handling.

8. Security and Privacy:
   - Ensure API keys and sensitive data are stored securely and implement encryption.
   - Example: Use environment variables to store API keys and secrets.

9. User Interface:
   - Develop a graphical interface using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
   - Example: Create a simple GUI with buttons for different commands and a display area for responses.
